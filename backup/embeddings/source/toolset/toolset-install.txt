Starkli Installation
Easily install Starkli using Starkliup, an installer invoked through the command line.

curl https://get.starkli.sh | sh
starkliup
Restart your terminal and confirm installation:

starkli --version
To upgrade Starkli, simply repeat the steps.

Scarb Package Manager Installation
We will get deeper into Scarb later in this chapter. For now, we will go over the installation process.

For macOS and Linux:

    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh
For Windows, follow manual setup in the Scarb documentation.

Restart the terminal and run:

    scarb --version
To upgrade Scarb, rerun the installation command.

You are now set to code in Cairo and deploy to Starknet.
